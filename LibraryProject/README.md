# LibraryProject

This is a Django project created for learning and demonstration purposes. It includes a basic setup with the following structure:

- `manage.py`: Command-line utility to interact with the project.
- `LibraryProject/settings.py`: Main configuration for the Django project.
- `LibraryProject/urls.py`: URL declarations for the project.
- `LibraryProject/wsgi.py` and `asgi.py`: Entry points for WSGI/ASGI-compatible web servers.

To run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
